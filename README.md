This repo organized around [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

Usage:
```sh
stow base
# stow macos
# ...etc
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add rofi configs/styles/etc/resources
- [ ] Make a decision on initialization (imperative) (so far I prefer to stick with static configuration and avoid imperative-style init scripts)
